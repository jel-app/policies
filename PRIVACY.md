# Privacy Notice for Jel

Version 1.0, November 27, 2020

This Privacy Notice describes the way Jel deals with your data.

    <strong>Jel shares data via its servers to allow communication.</strong>
  </summary>

The name and likeness of your Avatar is transmitted to others who are members of the same Space. When you're in a World, we transmit your position and interactions to anyone else who is in the same World. If you are in a World that others have access to, they will be able to see your presence in that World. Your private Home World is inaccesible to anyone else, so your presence there will not be seen by others.

You can access a World if the World creator or Space administrator have set policies which grant you access. Our servers receive information about the objects, avatars, and interactions that happen in Worlds.

When your microphone or screen sharing is on, Jel receives and transmits the voice and video data to others in the same World. We do not record or store this data. We also send lip syncing information, if supported, to others in the room to simulate your avatar's mouth movement. Once you turn on your microphone or screen sharing, it will *stay on* as long as you are in a World, unless you turn it off via the user interface.

When you upload files to a World, they are stored permanently unless they are removed. When uploaded files are removed, their encrypted contents may be temporarily retained on our servers for up to 72 hours before being removed from our data storage system, but will be inaccessible to site operators and other users.

You do not need to share your email address with us to start using Jel. If you decide to verify an account with your email address, we'll associate your email with the account via a hashed version of it. We'll also add your email address to our contact list hosted on Mailjet (privacy policy: https://www.mailjet.com/privacy-policy/), which will be used to contact you with any essential information regarding your account. (Such as information related to security or privacy.) If you agree to receive optional email updates from us, we will also send you additional informational emails, which you can unsubscribe from at any time.

When you use Jel, we receive and store information about your connection, device, operating system, language, browser, and other information needed to operate the service.

We use Mixpanel (privacy policy: https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/) to understand how users interact with the product. For example, we may collect anonymized information about which parts of the UI are used during a session, or how long a session lasts. If youâ€™d prefer to opt out of Mixpanel data collection, you can use the Do Not Track feature of your browser (see: https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001113426-Opt-Out-of-Tracking.)

To help fix bugs or other problems, Jel sends error logs to Sentry which includes the log, URL, and other information about your session and connection that can be used to diagnose what went wrong. Error data is handled according to Sentry's privacy policy: https://sentry.io/privacy/.
