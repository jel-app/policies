### 5. Services Interruption, Term, Termination

The Terms specified here apply to all use of Jel and will apply until ended by either you or upon notice from us. You can end your obligation to these Terms at any time by ending your use of Jel. 

We may remove access to Jel at any time, for any duration, for any reason. For example, reasons we may do so include but are not limited to if we believe you have violated these Terms, or if we believe you create risk or legal exposure, or we decide we no longer want to provide or operate Jel. We will take reasonable steps to notify you in Jel when this occurs.

In all such cases when we remove access, these Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use Jel, except that the "Indemnification" and "Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability" sections of these Terms will continue to apply. 

### 6. Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Minddrop LLC, and its respective parent and affiliate companies, contractors, contributors, licensors, partners, directors, officers, employees and agents ("Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all third party claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of or related to your use of Jel.
